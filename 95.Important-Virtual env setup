When we run python from command line actuall what happend when we type python the command prompt looks for path variable and this is a 
global variable which stored path seprated by ; 
when we run a file it say command is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.This is happening 
becuase that program folder is not in path environment variable which cmd refer

In Real time we run python programs in there environment that is we create a seprate environment for a python project it is necessary as 
it may happen that different application is using different version of python

these seprated environment in python are called Virtual Environment and to create virtual environment first we need to install virtualenv

When we download python there is a cli which comes and resposiable for downloading python packages from cloud/CDN
and this command line is pip--Used to install package
Virtualenv:These manages our python directory project
to install any package we run the pip command as pip install <packagename>[=version] 
If a machine has mutiple python version then to run a specific python version we need to type python<version>

To Install virtual environment we need to run below command
pip install virtualenv

once we have virtual env we can duplicate the python installation.as virtual env is seprate so we need to install all the library needed
by our project.
To Creat virtual env we need to run below command
virtualenv <nameofvirtualenv> --python=Python3.7 if nothing is provided for 2nd args it will copy the default version of python as per path
2nd args also tell what program to run when we are creating virtual env

Now once virtual environment created no we need to activate it for that we need to lookout for activate.bat file under the <envfolder>/<bin>
/activate.bat from command line

once virtualenv is activated we will see that name if the leftmost corner of command prompt and command propt will behave like pythonIDLE
Now if we write Path in that we will get the path of python folder which is under the virtual environment created folder

then if we type pip install <package> then it will install all the packages into that virtual env
so this will resolve version hell problem and provide us a sepration of concern to our app

if we run a command pip freeze it will list out all the python liberary whhich are install under that virtual env and then we can import them
and can put in a file called requirement.txt
if we have all the dependencies liberary of our project in a file the we can share that file and the other user can setup virtual env
and he has to run only below command
pip install -r <fileName>
 this command will install all the libarary in that virtual env
