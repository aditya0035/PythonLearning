"""
each country has their time zone so each used see the time of there local time zone
UTC:it is global time zone we store time in that format and the then we add user Gmtoffset into that 
to show the datetime in there local time zone

Or if we know the datetime and timezone when the activity happend then we can show the other users 
of different country the value in there time zone

So timezone play an important role if we say time then we are taling about local timezone
